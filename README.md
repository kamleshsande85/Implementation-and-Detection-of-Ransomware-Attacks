# Implementation and Detection of Ransomware Attacks

## Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and detection of ransomware attacks. It demonstrates how ransomware operates, how files are encrypted, and showcases methods for detecting such attacks using various algorithms and techniques. The goal is to provide a practical understanding of ransomware behavior, its impact, and effective detection strategies.

## Features

- Simulated ransomware attack (encryption and decryption)
- File system monitoring for detecting suspicious activities
- Detection algorithms for early identification of ransomware behavior
- Sample  for testing detection methods
- Demonstration video included
 

## Project Structure

- Source code for ransomware implementation and detection modules
- Project demonstration video
- Project report for understanding 
- `README.md` - Project documentation


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kamleshsande85/Implementation-and-Detection-of-Ransomware-Attacks.git
    cd Implementation-and-Detection-of-Ransomware-Attacks
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the ransomware simulation:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Run the detection module:
    ```bash
    python ransomware_test.py
    ```

3. Review the demonstration video in the folder for a full walkthrough.

## Demonstration

A demonstration video is provided in the  directory. This video explains the project, shows the ransomware attack in action, and demonstrates the detection process step by step.
